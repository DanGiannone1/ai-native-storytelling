# AI-Native Business Presentation

## Audience
Executive leadership, board members, investors, strategic partners

## Duration
Single slide (expandable to multi-slide narrative)

## Key Messages
1. We're building a business that operates primarily through autonomous AI agents
2. The Agent Command Center is the orchestration and observability hub
3. 11 departments are being integrated - some operational, some in progress, some planned
4. This is a live, operational system - not a concept

## Story Arc

### The Vision (this slide)
Show the complete picture: a business operating through AI agents with a central command center orchestrating everything.

**Visual emphasis:**
- Central hub dominates the view (Agent Command Center)
- Departments arranged orbitally showing the scope
- Animated connections show the system is alive
- Status colors distinguish operational vs. in-progress vs. planned
- Progress bars show completion state

## Visual Style
- Dark, technical, futuristic
- Cyan for operational/active elements
- Violet for in-progress elements
- Glowing accents and animated particles
- Glassmorphism for depth
